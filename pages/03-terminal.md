# Quick Terminal Primer

```bash
pwd         # Where am I?
ls          # What's here?
cd folder/  # Enter folder
cd ..       # Go back
mkdir new   # Create folder
cat file    # View file
```

<!-- notes:
Practice live: navigate to Desktop, make a folder.

Get everyone typing early. Keep it simple.

Mention PowerShell: same commands exist as aliases (pwd → Get-Location, ls → 
Get-ChildItem, etc.). Flag that Unix-style options may differ; use native
cmdlets when needed.
